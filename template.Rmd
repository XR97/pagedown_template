# Part I

## Pagedown

Paginate the HTML Output of R Markdown with CSS for Print. You only need a modern web browser (e.g., Google Chrome) to generate PDF. No need to install LaTeX to get beautiful PDFs.

This R package stands on the shoulders of two giants to support typesetting with CSS for R Markdown documents: Paged.js and ReLaXed (we only borrowed some CSS from the ReLaXed repo and didn't really use the Node package).

You may install this package from Github:

## Page.js

Paged.js is an open-source library to display paginated content in the browser and to generate print books using web technology.
It contains a set of handlers for CSS transformations and fragmented layout which polyfill the Paged Media and Generated Content CSS modules, along with hooks to create new handlers for custom properties.
The currently supported properties can be found on the wiki.
A quick overview to getting started with Paged Media CSS and Paged.js is available on pagedmedia.org.
